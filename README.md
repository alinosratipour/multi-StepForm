# Front End Mentor Multi Step From 

I have developed a multi-step form project using React, Vite, Zod, and control statements. The main objective of this project was to challenge and improve my advanced React skills while delivering a dynamic and interactive user experience.

In addition to building the form, I have also incorporated unit tests using Jest to ensure the accuracy and completeness of data input throughout the user journey. These tests help verify that each step of the form functions as expected, enhancing the overall reliability of the application.
